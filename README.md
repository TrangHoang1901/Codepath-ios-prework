## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

[Done] Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
1. Example App: Japanese Doulingo
   - Listening and speaking exercises: Provide listening exercises where users can practice their listening skills by hearing native Japanese speakers voice. It also develops speech recognition technology to help users improve their pronunciation and speaking skills.
   - Live Chat and friends challenges: Allow users to create and join group chats to practice Japanese by setting which language is used in that chat. At the same time, a challange could be created or shared in group chat and show weekly result report summary directly on group chat.
2. Example App: Habit Tracking
   - Streak tracking: Display users' habit streaks to showcase their consecutive days of habit progress. The app can visually represent streaks through a calendar or progress bar, highlighting the user's commitment to the habit.
   - Reward system: Users can earn virtual badges, or unlock new features as their achivements whenever they reach milestones or maintain long streaks. Rewards can provide an extra layer of motivation and satisfaction for users.
3. Example App: Your Finance
   - Progress monitoring and reminders: Provide reminders and progress indicators to help users stay motivated and on track with their savings goals. 
   - Auto expense categorization: Categorize expense based on transactions to provide users with a clear overview of their spending in different categories like groceries, transportation, or entertainment.

[Done] Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
-  App Name: Japanese Doulingo
   - Vocabulary Building Games: Develop vocab-building games that engage users in a fun way like matching Japanese words with corresponding images and complete word puzzles to revise learnable words to make the games be associated with each learner
   - Reward system: Implement a system of badges to reward users for their progress such as 100 streak days, 100 learned words, 3 complete units, etc...
   - Voice feedback and assessment: Introduce a feature that provides users with voice feedback on their speaking exercises by analizing their pronunciation, fluency, and intonation, and offer suggestions for improvement. 
   - Cultural tips: For each new word, app will introduce some cultural senarios which will use that word and some customs or etiquette explanations. This will help users to understand more deeply.
   - Writing and Kanji practice: Introduce writing exercises where users can practice hiragana, katakana, and kanji by stroke order animations, and quizzes to enhance kanji recognition.
   - Progress sharing: Build a report graph to summarize their study progress and allow them to share with community or friends. This will encourage people to learn and inspire others to learn as well.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I got a while to figure out how to connect the button with ViewController class and my simulator did not work for the first time downloading Xcode so I had to re-download it again.
